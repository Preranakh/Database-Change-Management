# Database-Change-Management

Database change management is not an easy task. It is even more difficult when we are at the beginning of a project where the data model is constantly changing. More people in the team is another difficulty because we have to coordinate our work and not interfere with each other. Of course, we can delegate database change management to one person, but this results in a bottleneck. 

Through the codes and sql files included here, I have tried to show a good database change management and how ideal database change mechanism should look like when we are mainly working in the production phase of software development.
